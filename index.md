This is a preparatory lesson on [Git](https://git-scm.com/), which participants 
of CodeRefinery workshops are expected to go through before their workshop starts. 

The first part covers all the configuration steps needed before attending a 
workshop. It is important that all participants complete these steps before the workshop
starts.

The second part is a concise overview of what participants are expected to know 
about Git before attending the workshop.
